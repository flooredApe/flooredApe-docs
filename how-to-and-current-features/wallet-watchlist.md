# Wallet Watchlist

The Wallet Watchlist feature allows you to add up to 99 wallets. Each wallet will have its own unique icon associated for recognizability. This feature allows you to quickly switch between wallets without having to hold the flooredApe token in each.&#x20;

You can organize your watchlist by dragging and dropping in the edit view. The "delete" button is located on the right of each watchlist item.
