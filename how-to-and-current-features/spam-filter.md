# Spam Filter

If there are items in your collection that are picked up by our filter, you'll now be given the option to hide them in bulk.&#x20;

This is in response to some high spam numbers on the Ethereum main net. Usually a bi-product of low gas prices & more gas efficient ERC-721 smart contracts.&#x20;

It is important to note, do NOT interact with smart contracts of items that are airdropped to your wallet. This could put your wallet at risk to bad actors. Hide them, & forget about them.&#x20;
