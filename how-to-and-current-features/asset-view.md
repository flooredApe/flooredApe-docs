# Asset View

From traits to transactions - NFTs have a ton of data associated to them. This info should be simple and accessible, so we're introducing Asset View.

As seen above, there is a lot thrown at you. Let's go over it.&#x20;

* At the top of an asset page, you will find links to all available marketplaces. Making it easy to list, bid or buy another token.
* Just below that you will see all of the asset's respective traits, ranked by rarity & accompanied by the trait's floor price. This data is provided by Rarity Sniper, and its score will link you to Rarity Sniper's own website.
* A token history block can be found further down. This block includes all of the token's previous movements. Making it easy to see who owned certain tokens and when. This block also includes price data (Using the closing price of eth on the day it was sold.)
* On the left side of this page you will find a larger image of whichever token you are viewing, along with its floor value. Underneath it, you are given the ability to download the image/gif, transfer, burn or refresh the token's metadata. Just underneath that you are able to view the owner of the asset at hand, along with its highest bid.
