# Collection View

Data at a glance. Our goal at flooredApe is to provide valuable information that is easy to consume. Collection View epitomizes this.

Here's a breakdown.

At the top you will find some familiar features. Marketplace links along with key metrics and an interactive floor chart. However, you will find something exclusive to Collection Overview pages - A volume chart.

The left column provides the project's description, its contract and other important links. Under that, you will find the collections activity and all recent sales. Finally, you can view the collection's top holders, and even navigate to their wallet.

At last, you can find yourself toe-to-toe with the flooredApe's floor-by-trait feature. Here you can see all of the most valuable traits at a glance, and dive deeper by searching for a trait, and finding its respective value.
