### What is the decision making logic regards to the total supply?

The flooredApe NFT token is meant as an access token for the app. The supply is LOW for a SAAS –– most semi-successful web2 apps have user bases over 1million, our app would at the most have 50k users. We are looking into the future of this space to create a token that can be accessible to newcomers that need a lower point of entry. We want an even playing field for everyone in our community. We have purposed the OG NFT to be somewhat collectible in nature & will leave it up to the community to dictate its value based on supply/demand.&#x20;

### Will there be an iOS and Android app?

iOS and Android apps will be coming soon. In the meantime, you can set flooredApe as a PWA (progressive web app - or stand alone web app) by _adding it to your Home Screen_. For a detailed tutorial on how, check out [add-to-home-screen.md](../how-to-and-current-features/add-to-home-screen.md "mention").

### **Will flooredApe have cross-chain integration?**

Yes! We definitely want the community to track and watch their NFTs from other chains such as Solana, Polygon, etc. Stay tuned.

### **Can you add multiple wallets?**

This has been highly requested by the community and is on our feature requests list! For now, the Wallet Watchlist allows you to add any ethereum wallet to track NFTs –– you can watch your other wallets through this feature.
