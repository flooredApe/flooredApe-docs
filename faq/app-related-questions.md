### What is the decision making logic regards to the total supply?

The flooredApe NFT token is meant as an access token for the app. The supply is LOW for a SAAS –– most semi-successful web2 apps have user bases over 1million, our app would at the most have 50k users. We are looking into the future of this space to create a token that can be accessible to newcomers that need a lower point of entry. We want an even playing field for everyone in our community. We have purposed the OG NFT to be somewhat collectible in nature & will leave it up to the community to dictate its value based on supply/demand.&#x20;

### Will there be an iOS and Android app?

iOS and Android apps will be coming soon. In the meantime, you can set flooredApe as a PWA (progressive web app - or stand alone web app) by _adding it to your Home Screen_. For a detailed tutorial on how, check out [add-to-home-screen.md](../how-to-and-current-features/add-to-home-screen.md "mention").
